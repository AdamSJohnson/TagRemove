Tag remover is a way to remove tags from file names in given directories

This is mainly used to clean up files that have similar tags on all of the file names

Anyway setup a config file like this:
```
{The root Directory}
{Comma separated list of subdirectories}
{Regex pattern to find an episode number} or {false}
{Season Number} or {false}
{Tags to remove separated by new lines}
```

Easy Peasy
